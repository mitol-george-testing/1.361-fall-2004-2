Definition
----------

Technology that deals with soil (and rock) as an engineering material in civil engineering projects.

Examples of Application Areas
-----------------------------

1.  Foundations
    *   "shallow" e.g., spread footings for buildings
    *   "deep" e.g., piles for offshore platform  
          
        
2.  Earth Structures
    *   Compacted earth fill for dam
    *   Landfill for waste storage  
          
        
3.  Slopes and Excavations
    *   Cut slopes for highway
    *   Excavation for subway  
          
        
4.  Retaining Structures
    *   Slurry wall with tieback anchors
    *   Gravity retaining wall  
          
        
5.  Remediation of Contaminated Soil and Groundwater

Types of Input Required to Solve Above Problems (for Soil)
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Geology and Exploration**: General nature and extent of soils involved
2.  **Soil Mechanics**: Evaluation of Engineering Properties of soils and Theoretical Analyses to predict behavior of "structure"
3.  **Feasibility**: Economics, environmental, legal, practical
4.  **Experience**: Regarding what has happened in the past - successes and failures
5.  **Field Evaluation**: Measurements of actual performance to evaluate and possibly alter design during construction
6.  **Engineering Judgment**: Combined with above - final solution (increasing use of reliability analyses to "formalize" process)

What Makes Soil Mechanics Interesting and Challenging (CCL's opinion)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Soil amongst most variable and difficult of all materials to understand and model

1.  Complex stress-strain (non-linear, irreversible)
2.  Properties highly variable function of soil types and stress history
3.  Properties change with time, stress, environment, …
4.  Every site has different soil conditions - new challenge
5.  Soil "hidden" underground and data on small fraction of deposit

Emphasis on testing (in field and in lab) plus field monitoring
